  @moduledoc """
  Drab Commander is a module to keep event handler functions.

  All the Drab functions (callbacks, event handlers) are placed in the module called `Commander`.
  Think about it as a controller for the living pages. Commanders should be placed in the
  `web/commanders` directory. They should have a corresponding controller, except the shared
  commander.

      defmodule DrabExample.PageCommander do
        use Drab.Commander

        defhandler click_button_handler(socket, sender) do
          ...
        end

        defhandler click_button_handler(socket, sender, optional) do
          ...
        end
      end

  Remember the difference: `controller` renders the page while `commander` works on the living
  stuff.

  ## Event handler functions
  Event handler is the function which process the request coming from the browser. It is done
  by running JS method `Drab.exec_elixir()` or from the DOM object with `drab` attribute.
  See `Drab.Core`, section Events, for a more description.

  The event handler function receives two or three parameters:
  * `socket` - the websocket used to communicate back to the page
  * `argument` or `sender` - an argument used in JS Drab.exec_elixir() method; when lauching
      an event via `drab=...` atrribute, it is a map which describes the sender object
  * `optional` - optional argument which may be defined directly in HTML, with `drab` attribute

  The `sender` map:

      %{
        "id"      => "sender object ID attribute",
        "name"    => "sender object 'name' attribute",
        "class"   => "sender object 'class' attribute",
        "text"    => "sender node 'text'",
        "html"    => "sender node 'html', result of running .html() on the node",
        "value"   => "sender object value",
        "data"    => "a map with sender object 'data-xxxx' attributes, where 'xxxx' are the keys",
        "event"   => "a map with choosen properties of `event` object"
        "drab_id" => "internal"
        "form"    => "a map of values of the sourrounding form"
        :params   => "a map of values of the sourrounding form, normalized to plug params"
      }

  The `event` map contains choosen properties of `event` object:

      altKey, data, key, keyCode, metaKey, shiftKey, ctrlKey, type, which,
      clientX, clientY, offsetX, offsetY, pageX, pageY, screenX, screenY

  Example:

      defhandler button_clicked(socket, sender) do
        # using Drab.Query
        socket |> update(:text, set: "clicked", on: this(sender))
      end

  `sender` may contain more fields, depending on the used Drab module. Refer to module
  documentation for more.

  Event handlers are running in their own processes, and they are linked to the channel process.
  This means that in case of disconnect or navigate away from the page, event handler processes
  are going to terminate. But please be aware that the process terminates just after the handler
  finish - and it terminates with the `:normal` state, which means all the linked processes are not
  going to stop. If you run infinite loop with `spawn_link` from the handler, and the handler
  finish normally, the loop will be unlinked and will stay with us forever.

  ### The only functions defined with `defhandler/2` or `public/1` are considered as handlers.
  For the safety, you must declare your function in the commander as a handler, using
  `defhandler/2` or `public/1` macro.

  ## Shared commanders
  By default, only the page rendered with the corresponding controller may run handler functions
  in the commander. But there is a possibility to create a shared commander, which is allowed
  to run from any page.

      defmodule DrabExample.SharedCommander do
        use Drab.Commander

        defhandler click_button_handler(socket, sender) do
          ...
        end
      end

  To call the shared commander function from page generated with the different controller, \
  you need to specify its full path".

      <button drab-click="DrabExample.SharedCommander.click_button_handler">Clickety</button>

  If you want to restrict shared commander for only specified controller, you must use
  `before_handler/1` callback with `controller/1` and `action/1` functions to check out,
  where the function is calling from.

  #### Define Shared Commander with `drab-commander` attribute on all children nodes
  If you add `drab-commander` attribute to any tag, all children of this tag will use Shared
  Commander defined in this tag. Notice it will not redefine nodes, which already has
  Shared Commander defined.

  Thus this:

      <div drab-commander="DrabExample.SharedCommander">
        <button drab-click="button1_clicked">1</button>
        <button drab-click="button2_clicked">1</button>
        <button drab-click="DrabExample.AnotherCommander.button3_clicked">1</button>
      </div>

  is equivalent of:

      <div>
        <button drab-click="DrabExample.SharedCommander.button1_clicked">1</button>
        <button drab-click="DrabExample.SharedCommander.button2_clicked">1</button>
        <button drab-click="DrabExample.AnotherCommander.button3_clicked">1</button>
      </div>

  See `Drab.Core.this_commander/1` to learn how to use this feature to create reusable Drab
  components.
  See also `Drab.Live` to learn how shared commanders works with living assigns.

  ## Callbacks

  Callbacks are an automatic events which are launched by the system. They are defined by the macro
  in the Commander module:

      defmodule DrabExample.PageCommander do
        use Drab.Commander

        onload_init: do_init
        onload :page_loaded
        onconnect :connected
        ondisconnect :disconnected

        before_handler :check_status
        after_handler  :clean_up, only: [:perform_long_process]

        def do_init do
          # notice that this callback is called synchronously, so
          # it is not suitable for longer operations that could
          # slow down the main process.
          # Any operation here inherits the main process PID
          ...
        end

        def page_loaded(socket) do
          ...
        end

        def connected(socket) do
          ...
        end

        def disconnected(store, session) do
          # notice that this callback receives store and session, not socket
          # this is because socket is not available anymore (Channel is closed)
          ...
        end

        def check_status(socket, sender) do
          # return false or nil to prevent event handler to be launched
        end

        def clean_up(socket, dom_sender, handler_return_value) do
          # this callback gets return value of the corresponding event handler
        end
      end

  Notice that the order of callbacks is not guaranteed, they are all running in the separate
  processes, and are processing in the same time.

  #### `onconnect`
  Launched every time client browser connects to the server, including reconnects after server
  crash, network broken etc

  #### `onload_init`
  Launched synchronously just before the `onload` callback. Unlike all the others callbacks
  that runs in their own process, this callback runs in the main process, and therefore is useful
  to call those operations who needs the main process PID to operate correctly, 
  as e.g. the subscription to PubSub events.
  This callback is not suitable for hosting longer or harmful operations, since this 
  could slow down or broke the main process. Use with caution.

  #### `onload`
  Launched only once after page loaded and connects to the server - exactly the same like
  `onconnect`, but launches only once, not after every reconnect

  #### `ondisconnect`
  Launched every time client browser disconnects from the server, it may be a network disconnect,
  closing the browser, navigate back. Disconnect callback receives Drab Store as an argument

  #### `before_handler`
  Runs before the event handler. If any of before callbacks return `false` or `nil`, corresponding
  event will not be launched. If there are more callbacks for specified event handler function,
  all are processed in order or appearance, then system checks if any of them returned false.

  Can be filtered by `:only` or `:except` options:

      before_handler :check_status, except: [:set_status]
      before_handler :check_status, only:   [:update_db]

  #### `after_handler`
  Runs after the event handler. Gets return value of the event handler function as a third argument.
  Can be filtered by `:only` or `:except` options, analogically to `before_handler`


  ### `handle_info_message`
  Launched every time a GenServer/PubSub event to which you have subscribed is fired.
  See "PubSub support" for more informations.

  ### Using callbacks to check user permissions
  Callbacks are handy for security. You may retrieve controller name and action name from the
  socket with `controller/1` and `action/1`.

      before_handler :check_permissions
      def check_permissions(socket, _sender) do
        if controller(socket) == MyApp.MyController && action(socket) == :index do
          true
        else
          false
        end
      end

  ### Callbacks in Shared Commanders
  Handler-specific callbacks used in the Shared Commander works as expected - they are raised
  before or after the event handler function, and might work regionally (if they are called from
  inside the tag which has `drab-commander` attibute).

  However, page-specific callbacks (eg. `onload`) do not work regionally, as there is no specific
  object, which triggered the event. Thus, `Drab.Core.this_commander/1` can't be used there.

  ## Broadcasting options

  All Drab function may be broadcasted. By default, broadcasts are sent to browsers sharing the
  same page (the same url), but it could be override by `broadcasting/1` macro.

  ## Modules

  Drab is modular. You my choose which modules to use in the specific Commander by using `:module`
  option in `use Drab.Commander` directive.
  There is one required module, which is loaded always and can't be disabled: `Drab.Code`.
  By default, modules `Drab.Live`, `Drab.Element` and `Drab.Modal` are loaded. The following code:

      use Drab.Commander, modules: [Drab.Query]

  will override default modules, so only `Drab.Core` and `Drab.Query` will be available.

  Every module has its corresponding JS template, which is loaded only when module is enabled. This
  is why it is good to keep the module list as short as it is possible, if you are not using them.

  You may override the default modules list with the `:default_modules` config option:

      config :drab, :default_modules, [Drab.Query]

  ## Using templates

  Drab injects function `render_to_string/2` into your Commander. It is a shorthand for
  `Phoenix.View.render_to_string/3` - Drab automatically chooses the current View.

  ## PubSub support

  You can use the PubSub mechanism to automatically update your pages on data changes.

  Suppose for example you have a backend module that interfaces the database, and you 
  whishes to automatically update your page every time a change occours in a 
  database table by some operations made in other part of your application. You can
  implement

  Suppose you need to automatically update your page every time a change occours in a 
  database table by some operations made in other part of your application. You can
  implement a PubSub mechanism to react from the commander to any events you have 
  subscribed to: add the subscription to the desidered `PubSub` in the 
  `onload_init` event handler, then add a `handle_info_message/2` handler for any
  event you need to react to.

  Please note that the `handle_info_message/2` handler is a simplified version of the
  GenServer/PubSub `handle_info/2` handler, it expects a message parameter, identical 
  to the standard `handle_info/2` one, and a `socket` parameter, instead of the
  `state` parameters, and it doesn't have to return anything.

  For example:

      # the backend:
      defmodule MyApp.Backend do
        # PubSub stuff
          @topic inspect(__MODULE__)

          def subscribe() do
            Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, @topic)
          end

          defp notify_subscribers({:ok, result}, event) do
            Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(MyApp.PubSub, @topic, {__MODULE__, event, result})
            {:ok, result}
          end
          defp notify_subscribers({:error, reason}, _event), do: {:error, reason}

        # CRUD stuff
          ...
          def create(...) do
            ...
            |> Repo.insert()
            |> notify_subscribers([:data, :created])
          end

          def update(...) do
            ...
            |> Repo.update()
            |> notify_subscribers([:data, :updated])
          end

          def delete(...) do
            ...
            |> Repo.delete()
            |> notify_subscribers([:data, :deleted])
          end
      end

    # the Commander
      defmodule MyApp.Commander do
        use Drab.Commander

        onload_init(:do_init)

        def do_init() do
          # subscribe to any desidered PubSub
          MyApp.Backend.subscribe()
        end

        ...

        # handles the events
        def handle_info_message({MyApp.Backend, [:data, :created], result}, socket) do
          poke(socket, data: result)
        end

        # handles the events
        def handle_info_message({MyApp.Backend, [:data, :updated], result}, socket) do
